# Alfred-workflow-copy-selected-text-to-TextEdit
This simple demonstration workflow is designed to enable spellcheck of selected text which (for one reason or another) is not subject to spell checking in its original app.

A Universal Action takes the selected text, TextEdit is opened (so it's the frontmost app), the selected text is passed to the clipboard. The `Copy to clipboard` action has both of these options checked:

- `Automatically paste to frontmost app` (because we've ensured TextEdit is the frontmost app)

- `Mark item as transient in clipboard` (because you presumably don't want chunks of text hanging around on the clipboard).

TextEdit should highlight any words it consider misspelledâ€”then, of course, it's up to you close TextEdit and choose not to save anything.
